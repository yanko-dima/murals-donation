  TITLE: "Olena Yanko Artist",
  DESCRIPTIONS: [
    "Olena (Helen) Yanko is a contemporary Ukrainian artist born in 1989 in Netishyn, Khmelnytskyi region, Ukraine. She began drawing at a very young age, but it was after she broke both arms that she truly discovered her passion for art. During a prolonged recovery period, with her arms in casts, drawing became a source of solace and inspiration for her. She started redrawing illustrations from children’s books and realized that art was her true calling and an inseparable part of her life.",
    "Olena successfully completed her studies at art and music schools and earned both a Bachelor’s and Master’s degree in Architecture from Kyiv National University of Construction and Architecture. After working as an architect and interior designer, she dedicated herself fully to art with the onset of the full-scale invasion.",
    "Olena’s artistic inspiration comes from the harmony of nature—mountains, trees, clouds, and endless expanses—which she strives to capture in her paintings, conveying their boundless energy. However, she is also deeply engaged in exploring significant social themes, such as violence, issues, and loss, which she examines through personal reflection and contemplation. These topics evoke deep emotions and form a crucial part of her artistic expression.",
    "She places special emphasis on interior murals and wall paintings. Her work focuses on creating unique spatial solutions that not only decorate a space but also contribute to healing and positive transformation. Olena uses art to make the surrounding environment more human and emotionally enriched.",
